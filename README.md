Automatic 3D point cloud registration is a main issue in computer vision and photogrammetry. The most commonly adopted solution is the well-known ICP (Iterative Closest Point) algorithm. This standard approach performs a fine registration of two overlapping point clouds by iteratively estimating the transformation parameters, and assuming that good a priori alignment is provided. A large body of literature has proposed many variations of this algorithm in order to improve each step of the process. The research paper [”IMPROVING 3D LIDAR POINT CLOUD REGISTRATION USING OPTIMAL NEIGHBORHOOD KNOWLEDGE”](https://isprs-annals.copernicus.org/articles/I-3/111/2012/isprsannals-I-3-111-2012.pdf) written by Adrien Gressin, Clément Mallet, Nicolas David and published in 2012 presents a way to improve this method by using local descriptors around each point. The paper additionally compares the result of different ICP variants on three different point clouds.

We implemented all new ICP variants, and tested their performance on 5 new point clouds.
